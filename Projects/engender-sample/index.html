      </p>

      <h3>JOB SUMMARY:</h3>
      <p>
        The Junior Web Developer programs and updates the web sites and other online systems that support EngenderHealth’s communications, marketing, and fundraising goals. He/She works with the Web Producer to ensure that these sites and systems are functioning smoothly, with the appearance and interactivity they are intended to have. 
      </p>

      <h3>RESPONSIBILITIES:</h3>
      <p>
        The Junior Web Developer has the following responsibilities:
        Maintain smooth operation and clean coding in HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, PHP, and XML/XSL, across a variety of web sites and systems.
        Update and expand web sites with new pages or features, by programming and testing them prior to launch, and then supporting them if and when technical problems arise.
        Provide training and technical support to non-technical EngenderHealth staff, including remote users, on the Cascade content management system and Wordpress blogs.
      </p>

      <h3>EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE & CERTIFICATIONS:</h3>
      <p>
        At least a Bachelor’s degree in web development, web programming, or other relevant field.
        Experience building at least one successful, operational public web site, from concept through programming, testing, and launch.  This experience should include close collaboration with the site’s web designer(s).
        A minimum of one years’ professional experience in an online design and development environment.
        Experience with any major database-driven web site content management system; specific experience in Cascade is a significant plus.
        Experience with international nonprofits, online fundraising systems, constituent management systems, and server administration, are each a significant plus.
        Direct web design or UI/UX design experience is a significant plus. Applicants with such experience should submit portfolios (files or URLs) with their résumés.
      </p>

      <h3>KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & ABILITIES:</h3>
      <p>
        Strong practical knowledge of PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and XSL, with at least the basic ability to program clean, readable, optimal code in these languages.
        The skill to read pre-existing code to decipher what it does, and how; and to then adjust it to meet new needs/specifications without breaking prior functionality.
        An ability to take an existing web site and, with the support of a web designer, extend the site with new pages or functionality while preserving visual design and branding.
        A basic understanding of core Internet services in a LAMP server environment, such as SSH, SFTP, HTTP/HTTPS, Apache (particularly mod_rewrite), etc., as well as UNIX-based command line interfaces.
        An understanding of responsive/mobile web CSS, as well as the various practical differences between common browsers.
        At least basic knowledge of visual design concepts — the stronger this knowledge, the better.
        The ability to think critically and plan the programming needs of a project before beginning code, anticipating issues and solving them ahead of time.
        The ability to work independently, reliably completing projects and meeting deadlines without constant supervision.
        Experience working with colleagues who telecommute or work from at remote offices.
        The skill to research and learn new systems, approaches, and solutions, as needed to solve problems on the job.
        Good written and oral communication skills.
        Familiarity with WordPress, DreamWeaver, Photoshop, and Microsoft Office are each a significant plus. 
        Knowledge of a foreign language, especially French, is a plus.
