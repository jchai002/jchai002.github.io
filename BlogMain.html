    GitHub Explained</a><BR>

    <p class="preview">The github logo is a kitty cat with octopus tentacles, because although a seasoned coder might think this website feels cute and cuddly, to a newbie it's actually quite daunting like looking at a big tangled ball of tentacles. Github is basically a code sharing service that doubles as a hosting server that doubles as facebook. Although it's not as user-friendly as facebook, so it's more like the early day myspace. But for coders, GitHub is an essential tool that minimizes wasted work by promoting structured communication...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/t1-git-blog.html">(click to read more)</a></p>

    <p class="preview">At first glance, there doesn't seem to be any difference between Class and ID. Both of them can be assigned to HTML elements as behavior modifiers. I thought that ID's can only be assigned to one element, but that's not the case either. There is nothing in the HTML and CSS languages to prevent the same ID being assigned to multiple elements. The only difference between Class and ID comes down to specificity, which led to certain conventions in their usage...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/t2-css-blog.html">(click to read more)</a></p>

    <p class="preview">In my last tech blog post, I talked about the most commonly used collection classes in Ruby, Arrays and Hashes. Ruby has numerous enumerable methods that allows us to manipulate these collections in batch by harnessing the power of iteration (which is just a fancy way to say doing the samething to multiple items in a list). In this article, I will go into detail about one of my favorite enumerable methods: the map method...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/t4-enumerable-methods.html">(click to read more)</a></p>

    Ruby Classes: How to be Classy like Tony Stark</a><BR>

    <p class="preview"> What is a ruby class? No, it's not a course about a precious stone at your local community college. In Ruby, a class is a useful way to organize multiple methods and objects. Ruby classes is a broad subject, with many features like class variables, class methods, instance variables, etc. In this post, I will focus on the basics of class creation, how to make an instance of that class, and how to make instance methods. I will also introduce the concept of class inheritance and how to use it...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/t5-ruby-classes.html">(click to read more)</a> </p>

    <p class="preview"> Last night I went to a meetup held at DBC Headquarters in San Francisco, and I had a chance to take a look around the DBC workspace. It was past 8 p.m. but there were still at least 20 on-site sudents there, hacking away at their keyboards, trying to complete their final Projects. "Have they been here all day?" I asked my guide. "Yep," he said,"and sometimes they pull all nighters." So that's going to be me in a few months, and it soon dawned on me that I'm going to be spending a lot of time with my cohort. Then another realization hit me: my time at DBC can be either very pleasant or very unbearable depending on my relationships with my cohort mates...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/c5-feedback.html">(click to read more)</a> </p>

    The Magic of Modules</a><BR>

    <p class="preview"> In a previous post, I introduced the idea of Ruby classes and inheritance. In particular, I mentioned that Ruby only allows single inheritance, meaning each class can only inherit from one single superclass. Since inheritance is a good way for newly created classes to understand a bunch of methods off the bat, this limitation seems to put Ruby at a disadvantage to other Object Oriented Languages. But that is not the case. Ruby provides another way for a class to gain access to a set of methods: modules. If you've read my previous technical blog posts, you may have noticed that I like to use pop culture references as examples to explain Ruby concepts, and this post is no exception.

    <p class="preview"> When I first started looking into the tech industry a few months ago, I stumbled up on an article about an female software engineering quiting Amazon because she found the work environment unwelcoming. A quick google search returns tons of articles mentioning this problem women face in tech. This was eye opening for me and somewhat surprising for me. I've always known that there are more dudes than gals in the tech industry, but I thought it was because a lot of us guys were socially awkward teenagers who spent a lot of time playing on computers and subsequently fell in love with the machines. That may explain part of the puzzle, but another part is that women in tech have to deal with this thing called stereotype threat...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/c6-stereotype-threat.html">(click to read more)</a> </p>

    <p class="preview"> In a previous post, I talked about the concept of Ruby iterators, which allows us to work on every single element of a collection. Javascript doesn't have the plethora of built in iterator methods like Ruby, but we can still achieve some of the same goals using the all powerful for loop. But first, lets quickly review Ruby iterators. Today I will take my examples from the popular TV series Breaking Bad. In Breaking Bad, the protagonist Walter White is a drug kingpin with a lot of bad-ass quotes. If we want him to spit out all of his lines at once, we can collect his best quotes and save it in an array, then we can iterate over this array with...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/t7-JavaScript.html">(click to read more)</a> </p>

    <p class="preview"> Since I'm getting into programming from another field, I was never exposed to many of the more fundamental computer science concepts (and there are A LOT of concepts in this field). The thing is, in a field that is already huge and still growing as we speak, we may never need a very deep understanding of certain topics. I'm a big proponent of learning only what you need. Going deep is the domain of academics and porn stars, and as most us who went through four years of college knew, academia doesn't provide a lot of practical knowledge. That being said, having some exposure to basic computer science concepts are definitely very helpful in terms of providing context for the practical skills. So in this article I will scratch the surface of a fundamental CS topic: dynamic and static typing...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/t8-tech.html">(click to read more)</a> </p>

    <p class="preview"> We've all experienced the destructive emotion known as anger. We've felt that unexpected, slippery, liquid fireball surging up from the pits of our stomaches. We've allowed that invisible hand to take control of our thoughts, reducing us to the most volatile state of a feral beast, ready to tear to shreds the next unfortunate soul who dare to provoke us. We are only human, and not all of us are masters of our emotions like the Roman Emperor Markus Aurelius or other stoic thinkers of the ancient times. There are so much stimuli and stress factors in our fast paced modern lives, that conflicts are bound to arise. Conflict resolution is an art, but there are still clear guidelines and tips that would facilitate the process. In this article, I will share some of my favorite tactics for getting out of hairy situations (Note: you might not agree of some of these strategies, but much like in coding, where multiple approaches can be used to accomplish the same goal, conflicts can be resolved in multiple ways.
