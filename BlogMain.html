    GitHub Explained</a><BR>
    <span class="date">05.23.15</span>
    <p class="preview">The github logo is a kitty cat with octopus tentacles, because although a seasoned coder might think this website feels cute and cuddly, to a newbie it's actually quite daunting like looking at a big tangled ball of tentacles. Github is basically a code sharing service that doubles as a hosting server that doubles as facebook. Although it's not as user-friendly as facebook, so it's more like the early day myspace. But for coders, GitHub is an essential tool that minimizes wasted work by promoting structured communication...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/t1-git-blog.html">(click to read more)</a></p>

    <span class="date">05.30.15</span>
    <p class="preview">At first glance, there doesn't seem to be any difference between Class and ID. Both of them can be assigned to HTML elements as behavior modifiers. I thought that ID's can only be assigned to one element, but that's not the case either. There is nothing in the HTML and CSS languages to prevent the same ID being assigned to multiple elements. The only difference between Class and ID comes down to specificity, which led to certain conventions in their usage...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/t2-css-blog.html">(click to read more)</a></p>

    <p class="preview">Ruby has several classes of objects to collect multiple items in one object, two of these classes are Array and Hash.

    Ruby Enumerable Methods: A Force To Be Reckoned With</a><BR>
    <span class="date">06.11.15</span>
    <p class="preview">In my last tech blog post, I talked about the most commonly used collection classes in Ruby, Arrays and Hashes. Ruby has numerous enumerable methods that allows us to manipulate these collections in batch by harnessing the power of iteration (which is just a fancy way to say doing the samething to multiple items in a list). In this article, I will go into detail about one of my favorite enumerable methods: the map method...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/t4-enumerable-methods.html">(click to read more)</a></p>

    <p class="preview">About a year ago, while sitting in a hole in the wall cafe in The Mission district of San Francisco, I struck up a conversation with this beautiful Latina girl, Laura. We talked about everything and anything, but most of all we talked about the City itself. I mentioned that although I grew up in the Bay Area, I've never truly experienced San Francisco. My memories of the City mostly involve sitting in the back seat of a car while my mom drives her friends from China around its hilly streets...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/c4-tech-issues.html">(click to read more)</a> </p>

    Ruby Classes: How to be Classy like Tony Stark</a><BR>

    <p class="preview"> What is a ruby class? No, it's not a course about a precious stone at your local community college. In Ruby, a class is a useful way to organize multiple methods and objects. Ruby classes is a broad subject, with many features like class variables, class methods, instance variables, etc. In this post, I will focus on the basics of class creation, how to make an instance of that class, and how to make instance methods. I will also introduce the concept of class inheritance and how to use it...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/t5-ruby-classes.html">(click to read more)</a> </p>

    Open Mind Night: On taking Feedbacks and Keeping an Open Mike</a><BR>
    <span class="date">06.19.15</span>
    <p class="preview"> Last night I went to a meetup held at DBC Headquarters in San Francisco, and I had a chance to take a look around the DBC workspace. It was past 8 p.m. but there were still at least 20 on-site sudents there, hacking away at their keyboards, trying to complete their final projects. "Have they been here all day?" I asked my guide. "Yep," he said,"and sometimes they pull all nighters." So that's going to be me in a few months, and it soon dawned on me that I'm going to be spending a lot of time with my cohort. Then another realization hit me: my time at DBC can be either very pleasant or very unbearable depending on my relationships with my cohort mates...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/c5-feedback.html">(click to read more)</a> </p>

    Frowning away the Stereotype Threat</a><BR>

    <p class="preview"> When I first started looking into the tech industry a few months ago, I stumbled up on an article about an female software engineering quiting Amazon because she found the work environment unwelcoming. A quick google search returns tons of articles mentioning this problem women face in tech. This was eye opening for me and somewhat surprising for me. I've always known that there are more dudes than gals in the tech industry, but I thought it was because a lot of us guys were socially awkward teenagers who spent a lot of time playing on computers and subsequently fell in love with the machines. That may explain part of the puzzle, but another part is that women in tech have to deal with this thing called stereotype threat...<a id="bloglink" href="blog/c6-stereotype-threat.html">(click to read more)</a> </p>
