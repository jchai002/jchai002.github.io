  <h1>DBC Expectations</h1>
  <h2></h2>
  <h4>05.24.15</h4>

    <p>
        Now that my first week with dev bootcamp is coming to a close, I am pleasantly suprised at how smooth the learning experience is. Everyone is very supportive on the google+ community with good answers to my technical questions. I have feeling that I will become very good friends with the group even though I haven't met anyone in person yet. 
    </p>

        I'm quite excited about the learning environment even though we are just starting off. I like how DBC encourages people to take the initiative and be autodidactic while at the same time emphisizing community support. The nature of the software industry requires a lot of collaboration, and it's good that we are getting inducted into the culture from the begining. Being accountable to not only yourself but others who depend on you is a great way to push yourself to become the best version of you. This isn't like college or medical school where locking yourself up in the basement and digging your face in the book could still lead to success.

        Speaking of college, I'm glad I chose DBC rather than taking a bunch of college classes. I stumbled upon DBC after getting frustrated at how rigid the college cirriculums are and googled "The best way to teach yourself how to code." I found an article where someone mentioned a bootcamp that teaches web dev and thought it was perfect. It's a perfect balance between self-learning and structured learning.
