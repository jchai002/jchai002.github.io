    Hi, my name is Jerry Chai, and this is my DBC website! I am a developer in training, and I am very excited to start getting more involved with this field. The purpose of this website is to log my learning experience. It also serves as a practical platform for me to try out new things. As my technical skills improve, this website will be updated with more and more sophisticated features.
