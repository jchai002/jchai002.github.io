 <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    I was born in Beijing, China, and I moved to the U.S. with my family when I was twelve. I spent most of my teenager years in the Sillicon Valley, right after the internet bubble of the late 1990s bursted. Although I used computers everyday, I didn't really consider a career working with computers. I developed an interest in Biology during high school, so I pursued a biochemistry degree in college.</p>

    My Alma Mater is UCSD, in the sunny souther California city of San Diego. I earned a diploma in Biochemistry and graduated in 2013. After university I managed to get into medical school at LECOM, in Erie, PA. After a year of medical school, I decided to take a break and try my hand at something more creative and flexible. Which is why I decided to start studying software development at Dev Bootcamp.

    With my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and various physical activities. I have a pretty oddball collection of hobbies, such as:</p>
    <p>improv comedy

    I also like to do a little bit dancing here and there. Actually I really enjoy dancing, or more precisely, I'm not really afraid to, as 50 Cent puts it, "act a fool in Da club." I guess that's my quirk. I don't really get why people would go out to "da club" and just stand by the wall hugging their drink and do nothing all night. </p>
